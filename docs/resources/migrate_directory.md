## Schema

### Required

- **path** (String) The path of the SQL migration files. For a path relative to the current module, use `path.module`.

### Optional

- **single_file_split** (String) Set this to a value if your migration up and down are in a single file, split on some constant string (ie. in the case of [shmig](https://github.com/mbucc/shmig) you would use `-- ==== DOWN ====`).

### Read-Only

- **complete_migrations** (List of Object) The completed migrations that have been run against your database. This list is used as storage to migrate down or as a trigger for downstream dependencies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--complete_migrations))
- **id** (String, Deprecated) This attribute is only present for some compatibility issues and should not be used. It will be removed in a future version.

<a id="nestedatt--complete_migrations"></a>
